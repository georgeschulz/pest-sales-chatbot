Response: 

As an AI language model, I can't physically help you with the removal of termites in your house. However, I can suggest some solutions that may help you:

1. Contact a professional pest control company who specializes in termite treatment. They will assess the damage caused by the termites, identify the source of the infestation and provide you with a treatment plan to eradicate the termites from your home.

2. Install termite baits around the perimeter of your property. These baits contain a slow-acting poison that will be carried back to the termite colony by the worker termites, ultimately leading to their destruction.

3. Use a liquid termite treatment that can be applied around the foundation of your home. These treatments create a barrier that prevents termites from entering your home and is highly effective at killing colonies.

4. Eliminate any moisture sources around your home, as termites are attracted to damp environments. Ensure that any leaking pipes, gutters or air conditioning units are repaired promptly.

Remember that treating termites requires specialized knowledge, equipment and chemicals. Therefore, it is highly recommended that you consult a professional pest control company.
