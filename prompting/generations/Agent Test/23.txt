Response: I understand. We have a quarterly service plan that is designed to prevent pests from entering your home. Our technicians will come to your home every quarter to spray the perimeter and any common areas where pests tend to enter. This service covers a wide range of pests like ants, spiders, roaches, silverfish, and more. Would you be interested in this plan?
