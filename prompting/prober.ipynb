The agent suggests that bi-monthly services are most effective for managing ants, but a one-time treatment can be offered if the customer doesn't want ongoing services. The size of the lead's house is also taken into consideration. \\n\\nOverall, based on the severity of the ant infestation and the recommended frequency of service, I would rate the severity of this issue as Medium. While it is not an emergency, it is a problem that needs to be addressed in a timely manner to prevent further infestation and potential damage to the property. The offer of ongoing services also suggests that ant infestations can be persistent and ongoing management may be necessary to fully eradicate the issue.\",\n",
