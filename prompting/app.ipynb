      "Thanks for sharing your ant issue! As I mentioned earlier, there may be some complexity to the situation, but we definitely have a great one-time service that can help. However, based on our experiences, ongoing services are recommend for ant issues just like yours. That's why I'd recommend our Castle Program. It's a bimonthly pest control program that covers pests and proactive rodent issues. With this program, you don't have to worry about ants, spiders, mild or moderate rodent issues, millipedes, mild roaches issues, crickets, centipedes, and other pests that may come your way because it forms a protective barrier around your home, adding extra prevention for termites and pests. Plus, you'll get a proactive annual termite inspection that reduces the risk of having termites for years undetected. It's the best pest control solution for issues like ants, spiders, millipedes, centipedes, and more. If you decide to get this ongoing plan, you'll only pay $149 for the initial treatment and $75 per month for the recurring treatment. You'll love it! Just click the payment link to get started.\n"
