       "\"Hey there! Based on the rat problem you mentioned earlier, I would recommend our Monthly Pest and Rodent Control program. It's a great ongoing rodent and pest control program that covers various pests, mice and rats. We come out monthly to do a perimeter treatment and set up and maintain a rodent baiting program to keep those pesky rodents at bay. It's perfect for customers who want year-round protection and peace of mind from those seasonal invaders. The initial price is $149, and it costs $85 per month thereafter. \\n\\nBut if you're facing a more severe rodent problem or want to ensure maximum protection against termites, I would suggest our Castle with Sentricon program. This bimonthly pest control plan covers most pests, proactive rodent issues, and even provides a Sentricon baiting system for curative or proactive termite solutions. It costs $1400 initially and $135 per month after that. It's a great option to reduce the risk of massive, surprise bills, as it provides year-round protection against termites. \\n\\nLet me know which one works best for you, and I can send you the payment link right away.\""
